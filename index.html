            <h3>Hello React</h3>
            <p>
              As its official tagline states, React is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework – it's not
              even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments. For instance, React Native
              can be used to build mobile applications; React 360 can be used to build virtual reality applications; and there are
              other possibilities besides.
            </p>
            <p>
              To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same
              spaces as — and utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web development frameworks. When we refer to React
              as a "framework", we’re working with that colloquial understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It does this through the use
              of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion of the user interface. These components
              can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the rendering work, leaving you to
              concentrate on the UI design.
            </p>
            <h3>Use cases</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not enforce strict rules around code conventions or file
              organization. This allows teams to set conventions that work best for them, and to adopt React in any way they would
              like to. React can handle a single button, a few pieces of an interface, or an app's entire user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              While React can be used for small pieces of an interface, it's not as easy to "drop into" an application as a library
              like jQuery, or even a framework like Vue — it is more approachable when you build your entire app with React.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, many of the developer-experience benefits of a React app, such as writing interfaces with JSX, require a
              compilation process. Adding a compiler like Babel to a website makes the code on it run slowly, so developers often set
              up such tooling with a build step. React arguably has a heavy tooling requirement, but it can be learned.
            </p>
            <p>
              This article is going to focus on the use case of using React to render the entire user interface of an application,
              using tooling provided by Facebook’s own create-react-app tool.

            <h3>Our app's user stories</h3>
              <p>
                In software development, a user story is an actionable goal from the perspective of the user. Defining user stories
                before we begin our work will help us focus our work. Our app should fulfill the following stories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                As a user, I can
                <li>read a list of tasks.</li>
                <li>add a task using the mouse or keyboard.</li>
                <li>mark any task as completed, using the mouse or keyboard.</li>
                <li>delete any task, using the mouse or keyboard.</li>
                <li>edit any task, using the mouse or keyboard.</li>
                <li>view a specific subset of tasks: All tasks, only the active task, or only the completed tasks.</li>
                We'll tackle these stories one-by-one.
              </ul>
              <h3>Pre-project housekeeping</h3>
              <ul>
                create-react-app has made a few files we won't be using at all for our project.
                <li>We're not going to write per-component stylesheets, so first delete the App.css import from the top of <code>App.js</code>.</li>
                <li>We are also not going to be using the <code>logo.svg</code> file, so remove that import too.</li>
                Then, copy and paste the following commands into your terminal to delete some unneeded files. Make sure you’re starting
                in the app's root directory!
              </ul>
              <code>
                # Move into the src directory of your project
                cd src
                # Delete a few files
                rm -- App.test.js App.css logo.svg serviceWorker.js setupTests.js
                # Move back up to the root of the project
                cd ..
              </code>

          <article>
            <h3>Defining our first component</h3>
            <ul>
              Defining a component can seem tricky until you have some practice, but the gist is:
              <li>If it represents an obvious "chunk" of your app, it's probably a component</li>
              <li>If it gets reused often, it's probably a component.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That second bullet is especially valuable: making a component out of common UI elements allows you to change your code
            in one place and see those changes everywhere that component is used. You don't have to break everything out into
            components right away, either. Let's take the second bullet point as inspiration and make a component out of the most
            reused, most important piece of the UI: a todo list item.
            </p>
            <h3>Make a ToDoList</h3>
            <p>
              Before we can make a component, we should create a new file for it. In fact, we should make a directory just for our
              components. The following commands make a components directory and then, within that, a file called Todo.js. Make sure
              you're in the root of your app before you run these!
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>mkdir src/components <br>
                    touch src/components/Todo.js</code>
              Our new Todo.js file is currently empty! Open it up and give it its first line:
              <code>import React from "react";</code>
              Since we're going to make a component called Todo, you can start adding the code for that to Todo.js too, as follows. In
              this code, we define the function and export it on the same line:
            </p>
            <code>
              export default function Todo() {
              return (
              
              );
              }
            </code>

          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="React_interactivity:_Events_and_state">
          <header><h2>React interactivity: Events and state</h2></header>
          <article>
            <h3>Handling events</h3>
            <p>If you've only written vanilla JavaScript before now, you might be used to having a separate JavaScript file, where you
            query for some DOM nodes and attach listeners to them. For example:</p>
            <code>const btn = document.querySelector('button');
            
            btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
            alert("hi!");
            });</code>
            <p>In React, we write event handlers directly on the elements in our JSX, like this:</p>
            <code>
              <button type="button" onClick=> alert("hi!")}
                >
                Say hi!
              </button>
            </code>
            <p>In the above example, we're adding an onClick attribute to the <button> element. The value of that attribute is a
              function that triggers a simple alert.</p>
            <ul>
              The onClick attribute has special meaning here: it tells React to run a given function when the user clicks on the
              button. There are a couple of other things to note:
              <li>The camel-cased nature of onClick is important — JSX will not recognize onclick (again, it is already used in JavaScript
              for a specific purpose, which is related but different — standard onclick handler properties).</li>
              <li>All browser events follow this format in JSX – on, followed by the name of the event.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
              Callback props
            </h3>
            <p>In React applications, interactivity is rarely confined to just one component: events that happen in one component will
            affect other parts of the app. When we start giving ourselves the power to make new tasks, things that happen in the
            <Form > component will affect the list rendered in
            <App />.</p>
            <p>We want our handleSubmit() function to ultimately help us create a new task, so we need a way to pass information from
            <Form > to
            <App />. We can't pass data from child to parent in the same way as we pass data from parent to child using standard
            props. Instead, we can write a function in
            <App /> that will expect some data from our form as an input, then pass that function to
            <Form > as a prop. This function-as-a-prop is called a callback prop. Once we have our callback prop, we can call it
            inside
            <Form > to send the right data to
            <App />.</p>

            <h3>Editing the name of a task</h3>
            <p>We don’t have a user interface for editing the name of a task yet. We'll get to that in a moment. To start with, we can
            at least implement an editTask() function in App.js. It’ll be similar to deleteTask() because it'll take an id to find
            its target object, but it'll also take a newName property containing the name to update the task to. We'll use
            Array.prototype.map() instead of Array.prototype.filter() because we want to return a new array with some changes,
            instead of deleting something from the array.</p>
            <code>function editTask(id, newName) {
            const editedTaskList = tasks.map(task => {
            // if this task has the same ID as the edited task
            if (id === task.id) {
            //
            return {...task, name: newName}
            }
            return task;
            });
            setTasks(editedTaskList);
            }</code>
            <code>
              const taskList = tasks.map(task => (
              <Todo id={task.id} name={task.name} completed={task.completed} key={task.id} toggleTaskCompleted={toggleTaskCompleted}
                deleteTask={deleteTask} editTask={editTask} />
              ));
            </code>
            <h3>A UI for editing</h3>
            <p>In order to allow users to edit a task, we have to provide a user interface for them to do so. First, import useState
            into the Todo component like we did before with the App component, by updating the first import statement to this:</p>

          <header><h2>Accessibility in React</h2></header>
          <article>
            <h3>Including keyboard users</h3>
            <p>At this point, we've accomplished all of the features we set out to implement. A user can add a new task, check and
            uncheck tasks, delete tasks, or edit task names. And they can filter their task list by all, active, or completed tasks.</p>
            <p>Or, at least: they can do all of these things with a mouse. Unfortunately, these features are not very accessible to
            keyboard-only users. Let's explore this now.</p>
            <h3>Exploring the keyboard usability problem</h3>
            <p>Start by clicking on the input at the top of our app, as if you're going to add a new task. You'll see a thick, dashed
            outline around that input. This outline is your visual indicator that the browser is currently focused on this element.
            Press the Tab key, and you will see the outline appear around the "Add" button beneath the input. This shows you that
            the browser's focus has moved.
            
            Press Tab a few more times, and you will see this dashed focus indicator move between each of the filter buttons. Keep
            going until the focus indicator is around the first "Edit" button. Press Enter.
            
            The
            <Todo /> component will switch templates, as we designed, and you'll see a form that lets us edit the name of the task.
            
            But where did our focus indicator go?
            
            When we switch between templates in our
            <Todo /> component, we completely remove the elements that were there before to replace them with something else. That
            means the element that we were focused on vanishes, and nothing is in focus at all. This could confuse a wide variety of
            users — particularly users who rely on the keyboard, or users who use a screen reader.
            
            To improve the experience for keyboard and screen-reader users, we should manage the browser’s focus ourselves.</p>

            <h3>Component-level styles</h3>
            <p>Although this tutorial doesn't use this approach, many React applications define their styles on a per-component basis,
            rather than in a single, monolithic stylesheet.</p>
            <p>
              create-react-app makes it possible to import CSS files into JavaScript modules, so that CSS is only sent to your user
              when the corresponding component is rendered. For this app, we could have for example written a dedicated Form.css file
              to house the styles of those respective components, then imported the styles into their respective modules like this:
            </p>
            <code>import Form from './Form';
            import './Form.css'</code>
            <p>This approach makes it easy to identify and manage the CSS that belongs to a specific component. However, it also
            fragments your stylesheet across your codebase, and this fragmentation might not be worthwhile. For larger applications
            with hundreds of unique views and lots of moving parts, it makes sense to limit the amount of irrelevant code that's
            sent to your user. You'll likely have app-wide styles and specific component styles that built on top of those.</p>
            <h3>React DevTools</h3>
            <p>We used console.log() to check on the state and props of our application in this tutorial, and you'll also have seen
            some of the useful warnings and error message that react gives you both in the CLI and your browser's JavaScript
            console. But there's more we can do here.</p>
            <p>The React DevTools utility allows you to inspect the internals of your React application directly in the browser. It
            adds a new panel to your browser's developer tools, and with it you can inspect the state and props of various
            components, and even edit state and props to make immediate changes to your application.</p>
            <p>On the left, we see all of the components that make up our application, including some unique keys for the things that
            are rendered from arrays. On the right, we see the props and hooks that our App component utilizes. Notice, too, that
            the Form, FilterButton, and Todo components are indented to the right – this indicates that App is their parent. In more
            complex apps, this view is great for understanding parent/child relationships at a glance.</p>
